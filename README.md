# DataSynth

DataSynth is an AI-powered synthetic dataset generator that can dynamically create datasets based on **user-specified columns and row counts**.  
It leverages **Googleâ€™s Gemini API** for text generation, and is designed with an architecture that supports **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for richer, domain-specific dataset generation.

## Introduction
In AI and Data engineering,synthetic data is a powerful tool for:
- Rapid prototyping of ML models
- Avoiding privacy concerns by replacing real datasets
- Testing ETL pipelines and analytics dashboards

**With RAG integration**
DataSynth can go beyond plain data generation - by retrieving relevant context from stored documents, it can create **domain-specific synthetic datasets**.
