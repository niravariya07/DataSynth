# DataSynth

DataSynth is an AI-powered synthetic dataset generator that can dynamically create datasets based on **user-specified columns and row counts**.  
It leverages **Googleâ€™s Gemini API** for text generation, and is designed with an architecture that supports **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for richer, domain-specific dataset generation.
